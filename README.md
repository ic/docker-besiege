docker-besiege
==============

Dock-based deployment for Besiege.

The goal of this Dockerfile is to ease the deployment of Besiege, together with Siege.

Besiege is itself in its infancy, but we can imagine what we could do in the style of [Micro Army](https://github.com/j2labs/microarmy), with Docker.
